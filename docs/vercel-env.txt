Vercel Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for the current repository state.

Notes:
- The current auth storage uses local file `users.json` for local development.
- For production on Vercel, persistent storage should be replaced with an external service (for example a database/KV),
  and its credentials should be added here in a future step.
